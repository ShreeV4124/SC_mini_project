# ðŸ”Œ ANFIS-Based Electricity Price Prediction using Smart Grid Data

This MATLAB project implements an **Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)** to predict electricity prices based on smart grid sensor data. The system leverages fuzzy logic and machine learning to model complex nonlinear relationships in energy usage and pricing patterns.
